# Seaborn-Statistical-Data-Visualization

Here, I utilized Seaborn, a versatile library for statistical data visualization in
Python, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two renowned datasets: tips and titanic, all available in
Seaborn's built-in dataset library. Through a variety of visualizations such as Box plots, Histograms, Joint plots,
Heatmap etc. I explored key trends and relationships in the data. The visualizations provided insights into tipping
behavior for Tips dataset and various representation based on their age, fare, gender etc for Titanic dataset,
highlighting the power of data visualization in uncovering meaningful information.
